## Introduction

I created EDI Vocab Hub as a website to provide some basic information about Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) in a way that's accessible for both adults and young people - contextualised into a school setting. 

The website makes use of HTML, CSS, bootstrap and limited JS. It's split into 5 pages with a home page. 

This site is my submission for AI Augmented FullStack Bootcamp HTML/CSS/Bootstrap - Individual Project.

## Planning

### Design & Purpose



### User Stories

In line with Agile methodology, I wrote user stories in the planning and development of my website. The full details of these can be found on my project board.

I considered the following perspectives:

- A first-time visitor
- A student seeking more information
- A teacher seeking more information
- A returning visitor
- A VI user/someone using a screen reader

### Project board

A project board was used during development.

### Wireframe

The website developed from my initial wireframes, with one of the main changes being the splitting of the tips page into two - one for students and one for staff.

![Resources Wireframe](assets/images/readme/resources-wireframe.png)

## Development

The website was developed using HTML & CSS with the bootstrap framework.

There was also some JS used to control the Nav Bar and form submission modal.

A project board was set up and used during development.

A github repo was used for version control.

The website uses customisation of styling for the bootstrap classes.

The home page was created first and this was used as template for the other pages. 

An AI (copilot) was used to assist in development. 

## Deployment

The website is deployed to github pages. This is very simple process.

Navigate to your github repo, click settings and navigate to pages. Then you simply select the branch and then save.

## Testing

The website was thoroughly tested before completion.

- Manual code review to find bugs
- Manual code review to check accessability requirements eg. alt text on images
- Check site with W3S HTML/CSS validator
- All links work and external links open in a new tab
- Manually test site locally. for example, rendering issues, images loading, navigation links, scale at breakpoints, check console for errors in dev tools, etc.
- Manually test hosted site
- Testing with Dev Tools Lighthouse

### Responsiveness

I tested for responsiveness using [Am I responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://jakecrichards.github.io/Vocabulary-of-EDI/)

which generated this image displaying my website across multiple devices:

### Validation

- Pass W3s HTML Validator

- Pass CSS validator with no errors.
- The only warning came from using variables

### Known Bugs

At the moment there are no major bugs identified through my testing. 

I am working on developing the search bar function and so have labelled it under development. 

I could potentially improve the hero images on the additional pages by overlaying text onto a background image rather than just utilising an image with embedded text. 

## Features

Carousel

Accordian

Nav Bar

Cards

Embedded YouTube videos

## Contents

All content was written either by myself, or for speed was written by ChatGPT/copilot. 

ChatGPT wrote, through careful prompts, the tips for both students and staff.

ChatGPT also contributed towards the definitions in the ABCs, although this was heavily editted by myself. 

I used the book "An ABC of equality by Chana Ginelle Ewing" to create the carousel.

## Sources

All code was either coded by me or suggested by copilot which I then reviewed and decided whether to implement.

One piece of code came from ChatGPT, which was the js for opening the form submission modal as this is currently beyond my technical abilities.

I also used ChatGPT to help generate the favicon image. 



## Reflections

This project was the first opportunity within coding for me to create something entirely of my own design, to test my skills and abilities, and to see a project through from start to finish. 

I found this to be an enjoyable, if sometimes frustrating project. Most of the time the frustration was caused by a lack of technical skill on my part where I could imagine what i wanted the site to look like but couldn't translate that easily. 

I definitely went beyond the scope of the assignment, mostly through ambition to apply what I've been learning so far. 

Thank you for reading.
