## Introduction

I created EDI Vocab Hub as a website to provide some basic information about Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) in a way that's accessible for both adults and young people - contextualised into a school setting. 

The website makes use of HTML, CSS, bootstrap and limited JS. It's split into 5 pages with a home page. 

This site is my submission for AI Augmented FullStack Bootcamp HTML/CSS/Bootstrap - Individual Project.

## Planning

### Design & Purpose



### User Stories

In line with Agile methodology, I wrote user stories in the planning and development of my website. The full details of these can be found on my project board.

I considered the following perspectives:

- A first-time visitor
- A student seeking more information
- A teacher seeking more information
- A returning visitor
- A VI user/someone using a screen reader

### Project board

A project board was used during development.

### Wireframe

The website was changed between planning and release. this was done since there were problems with the planned layout which were found after the website was developed.

## Development

The website was developed using HTML & CSS with the bootstrap framework.

There was also some JS used to control the Nav Bar and form submission modal.

A project board was set up and used during development.

A github repo was used for version control.

The website uses thorough customization of styling for the bootstrap classes.

The home page was created first and this was used as template for the other pages. 

An AI (copilot) was used to assist in development. 

## Deployment

The website is deployed to github pages. This is very simple process.

Navigate to your github repo, click settings and navigate to pages. Then you simply select the branch and then save.

## Testing

The website was thoroughly tested before completion.

- Manual code review to find bugs
- Manual code review to check accessability requirements eg. alt text on images
- Check site with W3S HTML/CSS validator
- All links work and external links open in a new tab
- Manually test site locally. for example, rendering issues, images loading, navigation links, scale at breakpoints, check console for errors in dev tools, etc.
- Manually test hosted site
- Testing with Dev Tools Lighthouse

### Responsiveness

I tested for responsiveness using [Am I responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://jakecrichards.github.io/Vocabulary-of-EDI/)

which generated this image displaying my website across multiple devices:

## Sources

All code was either coded by me or suggested by copilot which I then reviewed and decided whether to implement.

One piece of code came from ChatGPT, which was the js for opening the form submission modal as this is currently beyond my technical abilities
